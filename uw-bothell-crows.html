            <!--Background-->

            <h2>Background</h2>

            <p>Every evening, thousands of crows from all over the region converge on the University of Washington Bothell campus and the nearby wetlands to roost for the night. This behavior has been observed for many years and is particularly noticeable during the fall and winter months.</p>

            <!--Reasons-->

            <h2>Reasons for Roosting</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Safety in Numbers:</b> Roosting in large groups provides safety from predators. The sheer number of crows can deter potential threats.</li>
                <li><b>Warmth:</b> By roosting together, crows can share body heat, which is particularly beneficial during colder months.</li>
                <li><b>Information Exchange:</b> It is believed that crows may share information about food sources and other vital survival tips during these gatherings.</li>
                <li><b>Proximity to Resources:</b> The UW Bothell campus and its surrounding areas offer abundant food resources, including insects, small animals, and human-provided food scraps.</li>
            </ul>

            <!--Impact-->

            <h2>Impact on the Community</h2>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Visual Spectacle:</b> The sight of thousands of crows flying in and gathering at dusk is quite a spectacle, drawing bird watchers and nature enthusiasts.</li>
                <li><b>Environmental Impact:</b> While the crows play a role in controlling insect populations, their large numbers can also lead to significant droppings, which might affect the cleanliness of certain areas.</li>
                <li><b>Research Opportunities:</b> The phenomenon provides ample opportunities for research into avian behavior, ecology, and the interactions between urban environments and wildlife.</li>
            </ul>

            <!--Significance-->

            <h2>Local Significance</h2>
